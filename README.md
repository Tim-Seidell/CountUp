# CountUp

This site uses the last portion of the URL to calculate the time duration between now and another given time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

To get started, press the reset button and do what you wish with the page (Bookmark, set as startup page, etc.)

I thought of this as a ridiculous but simple way to store data on a static page entirely within it's url.
